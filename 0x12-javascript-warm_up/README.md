## Background Context
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

- Scripting (same as I did with Python)
- Web front-end
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, I will do some scripting. After, I will make my AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
