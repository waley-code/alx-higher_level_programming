A file is a container that stores information, right? In computer systems, a file is a contiguous set of bytes. Data in a computer system is always stored into files. Files can take different forms depending on the user requirements like data files, text files, program executable files etc.

A computer processes these files by translating them into 0s and 1s.

So all the text, images, videos that you store on your computer are nothing but a series of 0s and 1s.
